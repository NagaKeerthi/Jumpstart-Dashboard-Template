# Jumpstart-Dashboard-Template
Major Objective of the project is to reduce the over crowding that exists in pretty much any company tableau server by building Jumpstart dashboards for important categories.

A question that frequently gets asked among data people is 'How do I get started in answering a data question I have?'

This question has two perspectives depending on who you ask:

Data Seekers who want to easily navigate to data content and insights that have already been created.
Data Creators who want a way to see if a dashboard has already been created therefore reducing replication and allowing them to leverage the work done by their fellow Data Creators.

Tableau dashboards are the first and best place to go when we have such questions rather than writing a SQL query.

However, when the server has 1000's of workbooks, How do Data Seekers and Creators start navgiating content to figure out which dashboards and/or data sources are applicable for the questions they are trying to answer.

Thus was born the idea of a curated set of Company Dashboards which would serve as a common starting point that Data Seekers could use to focus their search for content and Data Creators could tag their content so that it would be more easily found and could also use to see if there were already similar dashboards.  

The Company Jumpstart dashboards offer a some foundational curated content for the most common subject areas and then provides a filtered list of dashboards based on specific keyboards related to that subject area. 
Data Creators will tag their workbooks with the appropriate tags so their content and insights can be found.

The main problems that we hope can be solved by having the Company Jumpstart dashboards are:

1) For Data Seekers, save time in searching for dashboards related to the subject area they are looking for.
2) For Data Creators, reduce the probability of creating a dashboard that already exists and find other bandmates to collaborate on like minded questions.
